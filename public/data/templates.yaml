    description: "AI-powered automation of computer tasks through Teams interface."
    longDescription: |
      This sample introduces an AI-powered Computer Use Agent (CUA) that integrates with Microsoft Teams to automate tasks such as booking flights, searching for products, and filling out forms. Powered by OpenAI, the agent interacts with computer interfaces‚Äîclicking, typing, scrolling, and more‚Äîwhile providing real-time updates through Microsoft Teams. It can handle a variety of computer-based tasks, including web browsing and terminal operations and also handle user inputs when needed.
      It leverages OpenAI's [Computer Use](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-computer-use) capabilities.
